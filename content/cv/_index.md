## Teaching and Mentorship

#### Lab Teaching Assistant Coordinator at UCSD (2022-2024)

Oversaw the PHYS 1-series labs. Supervised TAs, held office hours, participated
in curriculum creation.

#### Teaching Assistant at UCSD (2018-2022)

Taught PHYS 1BL, 2BL, 2D, 10, and 140A. Lab Teaching Assistant Coordinator
(LTAC/Head TA) of PHYS 2BL in Spring 2020, Spring 2021, Summer I 2021, and
Spring 2022.

#### Hathaway-Sycamores Child and Family Services Learning Center Instructor (2013-2016)

In my role as an instructor at Hathaway-Sycamores, I tutored K-12 students in
language arts, math, and the sciences within the Los Angeles Unified School
District (LAUSD). In addition to weekday tutoring sessions, I served as the math
instructor for the Hathaway-Sycamores Summer SAT Workshop, which was organized
in partnership with three local high schools from 2014 to 2016. I reprised this
role as an SAT instructor in 2017 and 2018 as a volunteer.
