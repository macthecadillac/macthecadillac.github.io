Stability analysis is performed on surface quasigeostrophic systems subjected to
a Kolmogorov-type "shear force" on the boundaries using linear and nonlinear
approaches. For a SQG system of semi-infinite depth forced on the upper
boundary, the most linearly unstable mode is $2.74$ the energy injection length
scale. This is contrary to two-dimensional fluid systems, where the linear
instability is greatest for long waves. In the presence of damping, the most
linearly unstable mode shifts toward shorter length scales. The nonlinear
critical Reynolds number across different damping strengths is found to be
qualitatively similar to that of Euler 2D systems. For an SQG system of finite
thickness being forced on both boundaries, its behaviour approaches that of a
semi-infinite SQG system at the large thickness limit. In the small thickness
limit, the behaviour of a symmetrically forced fluid layer approaches that of a
2D system, while an antisymmetrically forced fluid layer is not susceptible to
both linear and nonlinear instabilities. With ageostrophic effects, an SQG+
system of semi-infinite depth is much more prone to instabilities than an
otherwise identical SQG system in the absence of damping due to the instability
of long-wave modes. However, damping significantly suppresses such
instabilities. With increasing damping, the most linearly unstable mode moves
toward a smaller length scale. Contrary to the zero damping case, when the
damping is sufficiently large, ageostrophic effects have a small but measurable
stabilising effect.
