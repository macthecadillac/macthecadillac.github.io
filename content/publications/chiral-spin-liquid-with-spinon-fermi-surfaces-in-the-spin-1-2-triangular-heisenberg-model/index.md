We study the interplay of competing interactions in spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
triangular Heisenberg model through tuning the first-($J_1$), second-($J_2$),
and third-neighbor ($J_3$) couplings. Based on a large-scale density-matrix
renormalization group calculation, we identify a quantum phase diagram of the
system and discover a gapless chiral spin-liquid (CSL) phase in the intermediate
$J_2$ and $J_3$ regime. This CSL state spontaneously breaks time-reversal
symmetry with finite scalar chiral order, and it has gapless excitations implied
by a vanishing spin triplet gap and a finite central charge on the cylinder.
Moreover, the central charge grows rapidly with the cylinder circumference,
indicating emergent spinon Fermi surfaces. To understand the numerical results
we propose a parton mean-field spin-liquid state, the $U(1)$ staggered flux
state, which breaks time-reversal symmetry with chiral edge modes by adding a
Chern insulator mass to Dirac spinons in the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid. This
state also breaks lattice rotational symmetries and possesses two spinon Fermi
surfaces driven by nonzero $J_2$ and $J_3$, which naturally explains the
numerical results. This realizes an example of a gapless CSL state with
coexisting spinon Fermi surfaces and chiral edge states, demonstrating the rich
family of interesting quantum phases emergent from competing interactions in
triangular-lattice magnets.
