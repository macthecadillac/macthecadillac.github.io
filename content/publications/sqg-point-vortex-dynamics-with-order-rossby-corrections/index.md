Quasi-geostrophic flow is an asymptotic theory for flows in rotating systems
that are in geostrophic balance to leading order. It is characterised by the
conservation of (quasi-geostrophic) potential vorticity and weak vertical flows.
Surface quasigeostrophy (SQG) is the special case when the flow is driven by
temperature anomalies at a horizontal boundary. The next-order correction to QG,
QG+, takes into account ageostrophic effects. We investigate point vortex
dynamics in SQG+, building on the work of Weiss (2022). The conservation laws
for SQG point vortices that parallel the 2D Euler case no longer exist when
ageostrophic effects are included. The trajectories of point vortices are
obtained explicitly for the general two-vortex case in SQG and SQG+. For the
three-vortex case, exact solutions are found for rigidly rotating and stationary
equilibria consisting of regular polygons and collinear configurations. As in
the 2D case, only certain collinear vortex configurations are rigid equilibria.
Trajectories of passive tracers advected by point vortex systems are studied
numerically, in particular their vertical excursions, which are non-zero because
of ageostrophic effects. Surface trajectories can manifest local horizontal
divergence even though the underlying fluid equations are incompressible.
