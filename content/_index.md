## About me

I recently graduated from the University of California, San Diego, with a PhD in
Physics specializing in physical oceanography. My current research interests
center on geophysical fluid dynamics and nonlinear systems. I have a particular
interest in fluid dynamics in the context of planetary science. My PhD work
involved analytical and numerical studies of submesoscale dynamics in the
mid-latitudes. Beyond physical oceanography, I have a background in condensed
matter theory and was a classically trained pianist prior to my scientific
career.
